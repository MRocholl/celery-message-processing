# celery-message-processing
This is a example of how to use celery to process data and deploy to multiple targets. It has been written as part of a presentation for the 2015 NERD Summit, but the source code and tutorial can be useful for anyone who is getting started with celery and data processing and is straight-forward enough for anyone with a background in Python to use. The README file contains instructions how to get started from scratch (from a fresh vagrant virtual box, or any fresh Ubuntu install). I hope that this is helpful. Please send comments and/or questions to jpeck@esperdyne.com.
